# Video Player UI with JavaScript

## About The Project

This is a custom video player, with a custom functional UI. <br/>
You can click anywhere on the video and it will play/pause, if you hover towards the bottom, you will see the controls ui pop up. On the controls, you have the play/pause button, volume control, speed control, time display and a full screen option. <br/>
You can jump around in the video and you will see the current time and duration change. You can change the playback speed to your liking and of course change the viewing preference. <br/>
This project is intended for anyone who wants to learn how to achieve this with vanilla JS, or use the methods applied in their own development.
